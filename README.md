This repository contains a small python program created to cover the requirements of our first assignment for PIOT.
The program can be started through the command python3 assignment1.py but each individual task can be run by itself (example: python3 animatedEomji.py)

Each task can be reached by pushing a direction on the pi joystick. Left for task 1, Up for task 2 and Right for task 3. Clicking the joystick during tasks 2 and 3 will return back to task selection. Pressing down will quit the program.
